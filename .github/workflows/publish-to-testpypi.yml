  # Main job: build distribution packages and publish to TestPyPI
  build-and-publish:
    name: Build and publish to TestPyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Use the 'testpypi' environment for trusted publishing (requires OIDC setup)
    environment: testpypi

    # Define permissions needed for this workflow
    permissions:
      contents: read  # Read repository contents
      id-token: write  # Required for OIDC trusted publishing token generation
    
    steps:

    # Step 1: Clone the repository to access source code and configuration files
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    # Step 2: Install Python runtime (version 3.12)
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'
    
    # Step 3: Install required build tools
    # - pip: Package installer for dependencies
    # - build: Tool to build Python packages (wheel and sdist formats)
    # - twine: Tool to validate and upload packages to PyPI
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build twine
    
    # Step 4: Build the distribution packages (wheel and source distribution)
    - name: Build packages
      run: python -m build
    
    # Step 6: Validate the built packages before uploading
    # Checks for common metadata issues, dependencies, and package integrity
    - name: Check packages
      run: twine check dist/*
    
    # Step 7: Upload packages to TestPyPI using GitHub's trusted publishing (OIDC)
    # This eliminates the need to store TestPyPI API tokens as secrets
