        python-version: '3.12'
    
    # Step 3: Install required build tools
    # - pip: Package installer for dependencies
    # - build: Tool to build Python packages (wheel and sdist formats)
    # - twine: Tool to validate and upload packages to PyPI
    - name: Install dependencies

    # in pyproject.toml. This prevents accidental version mismatches between the
    # GitHub Release tag and the package
